The Vercel platform makes it easy to transfer domains between accounts, this can be done from the Vercel dashboard.

## Moving the Domain

By using this method, you will be able to preserve all DNS records attached to your domain. **Your domain may incur some downtime during the transition.**

1. Remove the domain and all of its subdomains from all [Vercel Projects](/docs/v2/platform/projects).
2. Go to your [domain's dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard/domains) and click "Move".
3. Enter the desired scope to move the domain to and click "Move".
4. You can verify the request by accessing the [domain's dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard/domains) under the new scope.
5. The domain move will be completed and the domain available to use on the new account immediately.

## Deleting the Domain

A quicker way to do a "domain move" between accounts is by deleting it first. This approach would **remove all DNS records** related to your domain.

1. Remove the domain and all of its subdomains from all [Vercel Projects](/docs/v2/platform/projects).
2. Go to your [domain's dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard/domains) and click on "Delete".
3. Add the domain to the desired account.

  Based on feedback from our users, Vercel is preparing a "project migration"
  utility, this is line to be released soon.
