As a hosting solution with a generous free offering, users may inadvertently breach our [Terms of Service](https://vercel.com/legal/terms) or [Fair Use Policy](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/platform/fair-use-policy). If you are the owner of a deployment blocked by our system and you believe this was a mistake, please reach out to us on [https://vercel.com/contact](https://vercel.com/contact) so we can discuss this with you.

## Blocking Process

If an account of deployment is blocked, the user will receive a message from a member of the Vercel Support team. In nearly all cases, a discussion will be had with the user well in advance of any action being taken.

In certain situations, such as a deployment that breaches our [Terms of Service](https://vercel.com/legal/terms), we may be required to act immediately to block an account or deployment.

Any account or deployment that is blocked can be appealed, to do so you should reply to the initial message sent from the Vercel Support team.
