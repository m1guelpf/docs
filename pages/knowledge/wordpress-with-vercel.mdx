The Vercel platform is designed for frontends and [Serverless Functions](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction). As a result, it is not possible to host a **WordPress server**.

We recommend using Vercel to host the frontend for your WordPress site and generating all of the required pages statically at [build time](/docs/v2/build-step) by using the [WordPress API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/). This is shown in the diagram below:

By generating your pages statically, your WordPress site benefits from the highest level of **performance, availability, and reliability**.
