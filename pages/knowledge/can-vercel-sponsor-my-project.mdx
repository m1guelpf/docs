Vercel is committed to enabling the creation, adoption, and development of open-source projects. As such, Vercel offers the option to sponsor these projects, covering the costs of hosting them in full.

To obtain sponsorship for a project, contact Vercel Support either via the [support form](/support/request) available from the Vercel dashboard, or by emailing directly at [support@vercel.com](mailto:support@vercel.com).

## Sponsorship Criteria

There are some minor criteria that are required to be fulfilled before Vercel can sponsor your project, these are listed below:

- The project should be open-source.
- The project should be static rather than server-rendered.
- A Vercel banner in the footer of each site page.
- A Vercel banner in the source repository's `README.md` file.
- All links back to Vercel should use a UTM tag with the format: `?utm_source=[project-name]`.

The Vercel banner will be provided by Vercel Support. Alternatively, you can also use the [Vercel logo](/design#dark-logotype) prefixed with the words "Powered by".

Vercel sponsorship is primarily for, but not limited to, open-source projects. We sponsor a number of educational and charitable projects as well. If your project falls under these categories, please [get in touch](mailto:support@vercel.com) and we will be glad to discuss this with you.
