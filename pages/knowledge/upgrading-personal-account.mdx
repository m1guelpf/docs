A personal account, which is on the **Hobby** plan by default, cannot be upgraded to a paid plan. If you would like be on a paid plan such as **Pro** or **Enterprise**, you will have to create a Vercel team. For **Enterprise** inquiries, please contact our [sales team](https://vercel.com/contact/sales).
