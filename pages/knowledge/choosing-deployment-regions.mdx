The Vercel platform caches all static content at [the edge](/docs/v2/edge-network/overview) by default. This means that without any changes, your static files are immediately available from all [Vercel regions](docs/v2/edge-network/regions).

[Serverless Functions](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) are deployed to the `SFO` region by default, this can be changed depending on the account plan.

## Hobby

For Hobby accounts, the default deployment region for Serverless Functions of `SFO` **cannot be changed**. As a result, it is recommended to locate your data source as close to this region as possible.

## Pro Teams

For Pro team accounts, the default deployment region for Serverless Functions is `SFO`.

These accounts are able to change this by [selecting a **single region**](/docs/configuration#project/regions) for Serverless Functions to be deployed in.

<Note type="warning">
  For the best performance, deploy your Serverless Functions in the region
  closest to your data source.
</Note>

## Enterprise Plans

These accounts are able to change this by [selecting **multiple regions**](/docs/configuration#project/regions) for Serverless Functions to be deployed in.
