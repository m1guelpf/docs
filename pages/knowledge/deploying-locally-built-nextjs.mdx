A pre-built Next.js application **cannot be deployed to the Vercel platform**. This is because it will be missing information necessary for Vercel to automatically configure the applicationâ€™s routing.

The Vercel platform will automatically handle building, configuring, and deploying your Next.js application for you. If you have customized your build command, be sure it includes `next build`.
