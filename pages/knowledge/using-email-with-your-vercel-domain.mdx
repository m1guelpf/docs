As Vercel is a platform focused on deployments, it does not provide a mail service for domains purchase with or transferred into it.

## Third-Party Services

Because many domain providers do not offer a mail service, there are a number of third-party services that specifically offer this type of functionality and are enabled by adding DNS records.

Examples of this type of service include [ImproxMX](https://improvmx.com/) and [Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net/en), however there are many more options available. For each provider, different DNS records are required to be added.

## ImprovMX

For ImprovMX, you need to add the following DNS records, replacing `example.com` with your domain:

<Snippet dark text="vercel dns add example.com '@' MX mx1.improvmx.com 10" />
<Caption>Adding an MX record to a custom domain using the Vercel CLI.</Caption>

<Snippet dark text="vercel dns add example.com '@' MX mx2.improvmx.com 20" />
<Caption>Adding an MX record to a custom domain using the Vercel CLI.</Caption>

<Snippet dark text="vercel dns add example.com '@' TXT 'v=spf1 include:spf.improvmx.com ~all'" />
<Caption>Adding a TXT record to a custom domain using the Vercel CLI.</Caption>

## Forward Email

For Forward Email, you need to add the following DNS records, replacing `example.com` with your domain:

<Snippet dark text="vercel dns add example.com '@' MX mx1.forwardemail.net 10" />
<Caption>Adding an MX record to a custom domain using the Vercel CLI.</Caption>

<Snippet dark text="vercel dns add example.com '@' MX mx2.forwardemail.net 20" />
<Caption>Adding an MX record to a custom domain using the Vercel CLI.</Caption>

<Snippet dark text="vercel dns add example.com '@' TXT forward-email=example.com" />
<Caption>Adding a TXT record to a custom domain using the Vercel CLI.</Caption>
