The main reason for Vercel not automatically generating an SSL certificate for your domain is because of an incorrect or conflicting **CAA** record. Domains with the correct **CAA** record will always have the value `0 issue "letsencrypt.org"` without any other **CAA** records being present.

## Verifying the CAA Record

You can verify your domain is using the correct **CAA** record by checking with [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net/#CAA/).
If your **CAA** record is incorrect, or another is present, we recommend you remove it and/or add the correct **CAA** record via our DNS UI. This can be accessed by clicking on your domain from your Vercel account [domain's dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard/domains).

You may also use the [vercel-cli](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#commands/dns) to remove and add your **CAA** records.

<Snippet dark text={`vercel dns add [domain] [name] CAA '0 issue "letsencrypt.org"'`} />

If you have followed the instructions above successfully, your domain should now automatically generate a SSL certificate.
