The Vercel platform does not support Nameservers on subdomains (subzone delegation). We recommend customers with this specific need to use another DNS provider.

## Managing DNS Externally

If you choose to manage your DNS outside of Vercel to make use of subzone delegation you can verify your domain for use with Vercel by adding an A record.

You can find more information on adding an A record to your external domain while using it to host a Vercel project [here](/knowledge/a-record-and-caa-with-vercel).
