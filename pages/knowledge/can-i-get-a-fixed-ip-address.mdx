Vercel deployments use dynamic IP addresses to ensure maximum scalability across [multiple data centers and regions](/docs/v2/edge-network/regions#routing). As a result of this, **it is not possible to offer a fixed IP address**.

The IP address used to resolve your deployment may change as your deployment scales or as it is requested from a different location over our [anycast edge network](/edge-network).

For information on whitelisting Vercel deployments, please take a look at [this article](/knowledge/how-to-allowlist-deployment-ip-address).
