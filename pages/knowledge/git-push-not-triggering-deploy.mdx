You might have pushed something to a Git provider and noticed that a new deployment has not been triggered. That's because we deduplicate
deployments and only trigger new ones that meet the requirements described below.

## Deployments Are Deduplicated

In order to make deployments faster and more efficient, we skip creating a new deployment if we don't detect any changes in the project's source files or [environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/build-step#environment-variables).
Note that a project's `README.md` is not counted as a source file and doesn't end up as a build output.

Make sure that you are commiting changes to your project source code before you push and our system will properly detect those changes and trigger a new build.

If you've made sure that a change to your source code or modified environment variables still did not result in a new deployment and your project is properly connected to a Git provider, please fill out a
[support request](https://vercel.com/support/request) with the commit hash in question.

You can read more technical details on build deduplication [here](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/platform/deployments#deduplication).
