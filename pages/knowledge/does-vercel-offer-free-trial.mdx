Vercel accounts are available in three forms and offer both free and paid options to suit the needs of all users. These options consist of Hobby, Pro, and Enterprise.

## Hobby Accounts

Every personal account on Vercel is a Hobby account. Hobby accounts are free of charge forever and intended for **personal, non-commercial use**.

There are no usage limits applied to Hobby accounts and they are subject to our [fair usage policy](/docs/v2/platform/fair-use-policy).

## Pro Teams

For working with a team, a Pro account will be required. This allows you to invite up to 10 members on a team.

Pro team accounts provide a **14 day no-credit-card-required trial**. After that, a credit card must be added to continue using your Pro team account.

There are no usage limits applied to Pro team accounts and they are subject to our [fair usage policy](/docs/v2/platform/fair-use-policy).

## Enterprise Plans

For large teams, or custom requirements, an Enterprise plan may be required. If you believe your project requires an Enterprise plan, please contact our [Enterprise department](/contact/sales).
