## How Vercel Support Works

Vercel has customer success engineers available in multiple time zones to assist customers all around the world.

Tickets are processed by the order in which they are received, this means that when you submit your request, you will need to wait for all previously submitted requests to be fulfilled before a response is received.

The exceptions to this are customers submitting tickets covered by a **support plan** or **SLA** - these customers make up a separate queue and receive support in line with the terms they have agreed with Vercel Support.

## Reducing Your Support Queue Time

To reduce your Vercel Support response times, you can put in place a support plan or SLA by speaking with our [enterprise team](https://vercel.com/contact/sales).

We highly recommend that businesses with production critical workloads or time sensitive deployments put in place a support plan or SLA. By doing so, you will be given a specific turnaround time for receiving responses from Vercel Support.
